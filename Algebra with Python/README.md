# College Algebra with Python
This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and challenging projects.

As you go through each part of this course in sequence, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.

Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra Colab notebook that you will be able to use as your custom calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for a deeper math and data science understanding.

Courses
Learn Ratios and Proportions
Your journey begins here as you learn how to set up a Colab Notebook that can run Python code. Then, use the notebook to follow along with the videos to learn ratios and proportions using Python.

Learn Parent Graphs and Polynomials
This unit will show you many different types of "parent" graphs, the basic patterns that make up more complicated graphs. Polynomials are mathematical expressions with "multiple things" - the more complicated equations that are built with basic patterns. You will see what these graphs look like, how to modify them, and how to do this all with Python code.
