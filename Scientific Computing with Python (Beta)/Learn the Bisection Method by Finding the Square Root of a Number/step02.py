# Step 2
# Give the square_root_bisection function the following parameters:

# square_target: The number for which you want to find the square root.
# tolerance (optional): The acceptable difference between the square of the approximate root value and the actual target value (default is 1e-7). 
# The tolerance 1e-7 implies that the solution will be accurate to within 0.0000001 of the true value and is a good default choice that balances accuracy and performance.
# max_iterations (optional): The maximum number of iterations to perform (default is 100). If the method doesn't converge within this limit, you'll assume the solution is not found.

def square_root_bisection(square_target, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=100):
