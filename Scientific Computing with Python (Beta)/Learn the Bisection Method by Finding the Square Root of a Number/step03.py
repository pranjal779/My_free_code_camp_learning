# Step 3
# If the number for which you want to find the square root is negative, the code should raise an error as the square root of a negative number is not defined in real numbers.

# Remove the pass statement and create an if statement to check if square_target is less than 0.

def square_root_bisection(square_target, tolerance = 1e-7, max_iterations = 100):
    if square_target < 0:
        pass
