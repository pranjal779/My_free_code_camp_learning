# Step 1
# In this project, you will find the approximate square root of a given number using the bisection method.

# The bisection method is a technique for finding the roots of a real-valued function. It works by narrowing down an interval where the square root lies until it converges to a value within a specified tolerance.

# Begin by creating a function named square_root_bisection. Leave the parameters empty for now.

def square_root_bisection():
    return true
