# Step 4
# A dictionary is another built-in data type in Python. A dictionary is a collection of data in the form of key-value pairs. 
# Dictionaries are defined with curly braces {} and they contain key-value pairs separated by commas. Each key is followed by a colon : and the value:

# {'amount': 50.0, 'category': 'Food'}
# In the example above, 'amount' and 'category' are keys, and 50.0 and 'Food' are their corresponding values.

# Create a dictionary with a key 'amount' and value of the amount parameter and pass your new dictionary to the .append() call.

def add_expense(expenses, amount, category):
    expenses.append({
        'amount': amount
    })

# "You're a wizard, Harry!"
