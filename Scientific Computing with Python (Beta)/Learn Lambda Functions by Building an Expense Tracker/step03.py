Step 3
Python has a handful of list methods. Such as methods for adding or removing list items.

You can add an item to the end of a list using the append() method. For example:

Example Code
example_list = [4, 5, 6]

example_list.append(7)
example_list now is [4, 5, 6, 7].

Try to use the append() method to add 3 to my_list. Then print the list.
```

my_list = [1, 2]

my_list.append(3)

print(my_list)
