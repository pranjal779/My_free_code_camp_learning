# Step 3
# The expenses parameter of your add_expense function will be a list of expenses. 
# You want to be able to add items at the end of your list. For that you can use the .append() list method:

# my_list = [2, 4, 7]
# my_list.append(3)
# In the example above, after appending 3, my_list would be [2, 4, 7, 3]. 
# Replace pass with a call to the .append() method on the expenses list. Don't pass any arguments to .append() for now.

def add_expense(expenses, amount, category):
    expenses.append()
