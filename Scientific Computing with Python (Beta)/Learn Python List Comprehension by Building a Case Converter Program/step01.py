Step 1
In this project, you are going to learn about list comprehensions in Python by building a program that can take a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string and convert that to a snake_case formatted string.

List comprehensions in Python are a concise way to construct a list without using loops or the .append() method. Apart from being briefer, list comprehensions often run faster.

Start defining a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that accepts a string named pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input. For now, add a pass statement inside the function.
'''

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    pass
