# Step 15
# So far, in this project you have not seen any usage of list comprehensions whatsoever. 
# Like you learned in the first step, list comprehensions are a more concise way of constructing lists in Python.

# Begin the transition to comprehensions by commenting out all the lines of code inside the convert_to_snake_case() function. 
# Don't delete them as they'll be helpful when you implement the logic using a list comprehension.

# Remember to add the pass keyword to the function body to prevent the code from failing during the tests.


    # return clean_snake_cased_string
    pass
def main():
    print(convert_to_snake_case('aLongAndComplexString'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# Congratulations, your code passes. Submit your code to continue.

# "Kool Aid Man says oh yeah!"
