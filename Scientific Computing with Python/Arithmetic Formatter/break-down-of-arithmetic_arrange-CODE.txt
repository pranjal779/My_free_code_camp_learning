The function arithmetic_arranger takes two arguments: problems, which is a list of arithmetic problems as strings, and an optional argument solve which defaults to False.

The function begins by performing some checks and validations. For example, it checks if the number of problems in the list exceeds five, in which case it returns an error message. It also checks if the operator is either '+' or '-', and if the numbers are valid digits. If any of these checks fail, the function returns an appropriate error message.

The function initializes four empty strings: first, second, lines, and sumToT. These strings will store the formatted components of the arithmetic problems.

It then iterates over each problem in the problems list. For each problem, it splits the string into the first number, operator, and second number.

If the operator is '+', it calculates the sum by converting the operands to integers and adding them. If the operator is '-', it calculates the difference in a similar manner.

It determines the length of the longest operand (either firstNumber or secondNumber), adds 2 to it, and assigns it to the variable length.

It right-aligns the firstNumber, secondNumber, and sum strings to the length value using the rjust() method. It also creates a string of dashes (line) with the same length.

It appends the formatted components of the current problem to the respective strings (first, second, lines, and sumToT) with additional spacing and separators.

After iterating through all the problems, it checks the value of solve. If it's True, it appends the sumToT string to the final output.

It concatenates all the formatted strings (first, second, lines, and sumToT) into a single string with appropriate newlines to separate the rows.

Finally, it returns the formatted string, which represents the vertically arranged arithmetic problems.

By running the main.py file, you are testing the arithmetic_arranger function with some example inputs and checking if the output matches the expected results defined in the test_module.py file. This helps ensure that the function works correctly.

I hope this breakdown clarifies how the code functions. Let me know if you have any further questions!
