# Debug a Pet Adoption Page

Sally, a pet adoption store owner, has built her first web page but there are some issues.

Your job is to fix all of the errors so Sally can continue building her page.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

Sally wants to use an image of some cats but it is not displaying correctly. You will need to fix the following in the img element:
Replace the href attribute with the correct attribute for the image source.
Replace the att attribute with the correct attribute representing short, descriptive text for images.
Remove the </img> closing tag because img elements are void elements and don't have closing tags.
Sally wants to use some links to direct users to the dog and cat pages. But the links are not working correctly. You will need to fix the following in the a elements:
Replace both src attributes with the correct attributes used to specify URLs.

```html
<h1>Welcome XYZ Pet Adoption!</h1>

<h2>See our cats!</h2>
