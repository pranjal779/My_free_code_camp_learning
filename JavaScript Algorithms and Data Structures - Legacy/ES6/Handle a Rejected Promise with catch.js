// Handle a Rejected Promise with catch
// catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

// myPromise.catch(error => {
  
// });
// error is the argument passed in to the reject method.

// Add the catch method to your promise. Use error as the parameter of its callback function and log error to the console.

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = false;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});

makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
  console.log(error);
})

// Output:
// // running tests
// // tests completed
// // console output
// Data not received
// Data not received
// Data not received


// Tests
// Passed:1. You should call the catch method on the promise.
// Passed:2. Your catch method should have a callback function with error as its parameter.
// Passed:3. You should log error to the console.
