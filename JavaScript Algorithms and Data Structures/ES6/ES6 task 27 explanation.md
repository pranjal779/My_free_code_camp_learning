### 1. **`responseFromServer` is undefined**
In your code, the `responseFromServer` variable is declared but not initialized, so it defaults to `undefined`. In JavaScript, `undefined` is considered a **falsy value**, which means the `if (responseFromServer)` condition evaluates to `false`. As a result, the `reject` method is called with the string `"Data not received"`.

### 2. **Why did the test pass?**
The reason the test passes is that **the test does not rely on the value of `responseFromServer` being explicitly set**. The test simply checks:
- If `responseFromServer` is a **truthy** value, does your code correctly call `resolve` with `"We got the data"`?
- If `responseFromServer` is a **falsy** value, does your code correctly call `reject` with `"Data not received"`?

Even though `responseFromServer` is not explicitly set to a value in the code, the test simulates different values of `responseFromServer` internally. For example, the testing system might set `responseFromServer` to `true` or `false` behind the scenes to check whether your code handles both cases correctly.

### 3. **How does the code handle this?**
Letâ€™s break it down:

- If `responseFromServer` is `true`:
  ```js
  if (responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  }
  ```
  The code correctly calls `resolve` with the expected string.

- If `responseFromServer` is `false`:
  ```js
  else {
    reject("Data not received");
  }
  ```
  The code correctly calls `reject` with the expected string.

Since your code handles both cases properly, the test passes.

### 4. **Why didn't we need to set `responseFromServer` explicitly?**
The FreeCodeCamp testing system is designed to simulate different scenarios for `responseFromServer` (e.g., `true` or `false`) when running the tests. This is why your code works even though you didnâ€™t set a specific value for `responseFromServer` yourself.

### 5. **How could you test it yourself?**
If you want to test your code manually, you can explicitly set `responseFromServer` to `true` or `false` like this:

```js
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let responseFromServer = true; // Try changing this to false
  
  if (responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

// To see what happens, use .then() and .catch()
makeServerRequest
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message); // Should log: "We got the data" if responseFromServer is true
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // Should log: "Data not received" if responseFromServer is false
  });
```

### 6. **Key Takeaways**
- The FreeCodeCamp testing system simulates different values for `responseFromServer` to check if your code behaves correctly in all scenarios.
- Since your code correctly handles both the `true` and `false` cases, the tests pass.
- If you want to test the behavior of your code outside of the FreeCodeCamp environment, you need to explicitly set `responseFromServer` to test both cases.
