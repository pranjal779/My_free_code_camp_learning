# Regular Expressions
### Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. 
### Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

### In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.
